Sync choice :

I uses a synchronization block, since just adding synchronization to the methods doesn't fix the inconsistent, 
which is about entering/fixing specifix indexes.

It's still not properly synchronized if you just add the word synchronized to the methods.

It should be implemented like :

synchronized(account[i]) {} 

To get a lock on the correct element and make sure each index is not modified multiple times leading to inconsistent results

COMPARISON OF RUN TIMES :

It is faster with semaphores than with normal synchronizations. It is not by massive ammounts however, just a little bit faster depending on the run.

It is the fastest with semaphores and thread server threads.

After that it was without synchronization, but the results there are inconsistent. So, the speed doesn't help.

For specific numbers, simply look at my output files.

As for the addition of a third thread, it made things even faster.
